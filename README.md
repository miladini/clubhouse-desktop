# clubhouse-desktop

This is an unofficial desktop client for the currently trending ClubHouse.

# Any bans on the accounts is possible so use it at your own risk!

Developed Using Electron JS + Vue JS + AgoraSDK.

For downloading the Mac/Linux/Windows compiled version go to releases section.

I know source code is a mess, but since it's been developed in a hurry ( about 30-40hrs ) to get it working and also since it was my first time using Electron, Vue, and Agora, i put my time into adding new features and improving stability instead of a clean code. So if you think it's a mess, feel free to make it clean and do a pull request.
Also i'm using a really old version of Agora web SDK and that's because new version of Agora won't work because of the limitation they put on the user agents for clubhouse ( at least i think so ).

# How to build source code
I've used electron-packager myself for bundling the app and building releases. You can do so using electron-packager too. I hope you do not build versions with minor changes and credit yourself for it!
